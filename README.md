# CARLA PRACTICE (on going)

## Introduction
In this repository, I will try simulate object detection with 3D LiDAR sensor. For the simulator, `CARLA Simulator stable ver.` will be used. And I'm planning to utilize connection between CARLA and ROS, especially for `ROS melodic`. Guess it will be long-term work for me, hope to be steady with it.


## Prerequisites
* CARLA 0.8.2 stable
* Ubuntu 18.04
* ROS melodic
